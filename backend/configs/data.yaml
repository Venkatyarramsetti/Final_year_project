# Training strategy notes
notes: |
  - Start with TACO pretrained checkpoint if available
  - Use yolov8x-seg.pt (segmentation) for transparent plastic detection
  - Class imbalance: upsample hazardous (x10), plastic_bag (x5) with synthetics
  - Validation split: 20% held-out, different scenes/lighting
  - Target metrics: mAP@0.5 > 75%, hazardous AP > 85%
  - Context-aware post-processing: objects inside 'bin' polygon = waste
